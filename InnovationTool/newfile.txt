The question is literally about the path   C:\Hello\AnotherFolder\The File Name.PDF   It literally has the separator \. That is what we are interested in.   You can do   String fullPath = "C:\\Hello\\AnotherFolder\\The File Name.PDF"; int index = fullPath.lastIndexOf("\\"); String fileName = fullPath.substring(index + 1);   If we had used this path on a linux machine with File.separator instead of \\, it would have failed.                         share| improve this answer                                            edited May 27 '14 at 15:11                                                                                                                                                       answered Jan 25 '13 at 16:41                                             Sotirios Delimanolis                        157k  25   263   377                                                                            	      		                                                                                                                                                              8                                                                                       &nbsp;                                                                                                                                    You should not assume that the path separator is always &#39;\&#39; - Java programs run on different operating systems that use different separators.

There is nothing to do about windows or linux. The same String could have been used in a linux system, ie. I didn&#39;t assume anything about where the value came from. If the question was more generic, sure, but, as it stands, I don&#39;t see the need. There are other related questions/answers for that anyway.                       &ndash;&nbsp;Sotirios Delimanolis                  Jan 16 '14 at 14:52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1                                                                                       &nbsp;                                                                                                                                    the last line of the answer is misleading. will it fail in Linux if we use [File.separator] ?                       &ndash;&nbsp;Mohamed Iqzas                  Sep 30 '15 at 16:12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1                                                                                       &nbsp;                                                                                                                                    @MohamedIqzas I&#39;m referring to fullPath.lastIndexOf(File.separator);.
